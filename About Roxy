## "Roxy" the flip flop
was an abandoned flip flop, who was mistaken for a coal and was placed in a 
bag of hot coals by accident. At 11:20, GMT-08, LA time, 
Roxy was discovered. She would be buried at 11:30. The search for her would begin
at 1:00 PM but she was not found, so the funeral for her happened, and a cherry pit was buried
in her place.
